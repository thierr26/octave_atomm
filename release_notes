v2.0.0

* Toolman now has a "run_all_tests" command (alias "ta") to run all test cases
  with a single command.

* Toolman commands "add_to_path" and "run_test" now accept cell arrays of
  strings as arguments, so that multiple toolboxes can be added to path or
  tested with single command.

* Checkmtree now has a "check_toolman_top" command to check the top
  directory (or top directories) as defined in Toolman's configuration.

* When performing a dependency check, Checkmtree now computes the number of
  SLOCs (Software Lines of Code) in the test case toolboxes and returns it in
  the output structure.

* Checkmtree now performs dependency checks much faster.

* Bug fixes:

  - Application template now works on Matlab R2015b and later.

  - Function text_file_lines (toolbox texandcode) now "sees" the empty lines.

  - Toolman commands "add_to_path", "list_declared_deps" and "run_test" do not
    fail any more when used without argument.

  - Toolman does not fail any more when a toolbox depends (directly or
    indirectly) on all the other toolboxes.

==============================================================================
v1.3.0

* New toolbox "physunits".

* Function is_matched_by now has an optional argument for case sensitivity.

* Function wio_consec_duplicates now accepts a column vector as argument (it
  used to accept only a row vector).

* Function is_integer_scalar now has an optional tolerance argument.

* New function prod_exact_for_10_pow in toolbox "math".

==============================================================================
v1.2.0

* New function outman_o in toolbox "outman_helpers".

* Functions host_name and command_window_width now work in Octave for Windows.

* Modification of the validation functions for numerical values: "Not a
  Number" and infinite values are not validated as numeric any more.

==============================================================================
v1.1.0

* New toolbox "outman_helpers".

* Aliases defined for Toolman's command:
  - "a" is now an alias for the "add_to_path" command.
  - "t" is now an alias for the "run_test" command.
  - "f" is now an alias for the "refresh_cache" command.
  - "l" is now an alias for the "list_declared_deps" command.

* Modification of the validation functions for numerical values: complex
  numbers are not validated as numeric any more. Only real numbers are
  validated as numeric.

v1.0.0

* Initial release.
